<HTML><BODY>The main part of the thirty-second annual report of Bureau of American Ethnology is a large collection of 
Seneca folk-lore. It is mainly for that collection that I run this report through PGDP.

<p>I've left the pages relatively large (slightly over 100k each), as the text contains 
a lot of small print, and it will sometimes be needed to zoom in to make out what letter
is being used.

<p>This is a hard work. Following the Phonetic Key on page 73-74, you can expect the following 
accented characters:

<p><table>
<tr><td>a with macron               <td>[=a]
<tr><td>a with breve                <td>[)a]
<tr><td>a with diaresis             <td>ä
<tr><td>a with diaresis and macron  <td>[=ä]
<tr><td>a with circumflex           <td>â
<tr><td>c with cedille              <td>ç
<tr><td>e with breve                <td>[)e]
<tr><td>u with breve                <td>[)u]
<tr><td>superscript n               <td>^n
</table>

<p>It is important to properly distinguish the various types of primes, apostrophe's, etc. For this
we use the following notation:

<p><table>
<tr><td>a turned high comma (like a small 6)        <td>`
<tr><td>an apostrophe                               <td>'
<tr><td>a backwards prime                           <td>[`]
<tr><td>a normal prime                              <td>[']
</table>

<p>You will find note-markers, which refer to notes at the end of the volume.

<p>Starting page 715, you will encounter about 28 pages of intralinear text. During the P-rounds,
please proofread this very carefully; during the F-rounds, please format them as follows, using
brackets and standing bars to indicate the alignment of the Seneca language phrase and the corresponding
English translation, as follows <code>[Seneca language phrase|English translation]</code>. Line-breaks in
the English may be unwrapped. Every phrase should be placed on a separate line, a new line should be preceded
by a blank line, and a new paragraph by two blank lines, for example:

<p><code>
<br>[Ne'[']|That (it is)] 
<br>[[=o][']n[)e]^n`dji`|ancient time-very] 
<br>[hodi[']no^n`sot|their (&lt;i>an.&lt;/i>)-lodge-stands]
<br>[ne`[']|the]
<br>[yadad[=i]w[)a]^n'|they-two-uncle (and), nephew]
<br>[ne`[']|the]
<br>
<br>[gano^n`s[)a]'oñ[']we`.|it-lodge, large-(was).]
<br>[Ne' [']gw[a=].|That-yet (But)]
<br>[diiut[']gon hay[)as][']`n[)e]^n'|always, (ever) he (&lt;i>an.&lt;/i>)-lay-supine]
<br>[ne`[']|the]
<br>[hag[)e]^n[']dji`,|he (&lt;i>an.&lt;/i>)-ancient-one (was),]
</code>

<p>The end result will be somewhat similar to what I have done in this book: <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/50008/50008-h/50008-h.htm#pb116"><i>The Kacharis</i></a>.</BODY></HTML>
